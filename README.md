Explanation of the HTML Code for a Musical Library Website

This HTML code serves as the foundation for a website called "Biblioteca Musical" (Musical Library) that allows users to search for their favorite bands. Here's a detailed breakdown of its components:

1. Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE):

<!DOCTYPE html>: This line specifies that the document follows the HTML5 standard, ensuring compatibility with modern browsers.
2. HTML Tag:

<html lang="pt-br">: This tag marks the beginning of the HTML document and defines the primary language as Brazilian Portuguese ("pt-br").
3. Head Section:

<head>: This section contains metadata about the document, including:
Character Encoding:
<meta charset="UTF-8">: This line specifies the character encoding as UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters, including those used in Portuguese.
Title:
<title>Biblioteca Musical</title>: This line sets the title of the web page, which will be displayed in the browser's tab or title bar.
Styles:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">: This line links an external CSS stylesheet named "style.css" to the HTML document. This stylesheet will likely define the visual appearance of the website's elements.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css">: This line incorporates the Font Awesome library (version 5.15.3) from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). Font Awesome provides a set of icons that can be used on the website (e.g., for social media links).
4. Body Section:

<body>: This section contains the visible content of the web page, which is typically structured using HTML elements:

Header:

<header>: This section represents the website's header, which often contains the website's logo or title.
<h1>Entretenimento Musical</h1>: This line displays the website's title, "Entretenimento Musical" (Musical Entertainment), in an <h1> (heading level 1) tag, likely making it the largest and most prominent heading on the page.
Main Content:

<main>: This section holds the main content of the website:

Search Section:

<section>: This section likely represents a dedicated area for the search functionality.
<form action="#" method="get">: This line creates an HTML form for user interaction.
action="#": The action attribute is currently set to an empty string ("#"), which suggests that the form might not be submitting data to a server-side script (like PHP or Python). The default behavior may be to reload the page when the form is submitted.
method="get": The method attribute specifies that the form data will be sent using the GET method, meaning the search parameters will be appended to the URL.
<input type="text" name="busca" placeholder="Pesquise Sua Banda Favorita" id="campo-pesquisa">: This line creates a text input field where users can type their search query. Attributes:
type="text": Defines the input field as a text box.
name="busca": Provides a name for the input field ("busca" likely translates to "search" in Portuguese). This name will be used to identify the search term when the form is submitted.
placeholder="Pesquise Sua Banda Favorita": Sets the placeholder text displayed within the input field when it's empty, providing a hint to the user about what to enter.
id="campo-pesquisa": Assigns a unique ID ("campo-pesquisa") to the input field, which might be used for styling or JavaScript interaction.
<button onclick="pesquisar()">Pesquisar</button>: This line creates a button labeled "Pesquisar" (Search in Portuguese) with an onclick event handler that likely calls a JavaScript function named pesquisar() when clicked. This function might handle the search logic, potentially sending the entered search term to a server or manipulating the page content dynamically.
Search Results Section:

<section class="resultados-pesquisa" id="resultados-pesquisa">: This section likely serves as a container for displaying the search results.
